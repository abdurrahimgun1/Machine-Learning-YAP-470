Machine learning is learning a system without explicit programming, with or without data, of the relevant model. There are basically 3 types of learning depending on whether there is data or not and whether the data is labeled or not. In supervised learning, the model is trained with labeled data. Supervised learning models can be used for classification or regression problems. Within the scope of this report, will be examined which supervised learning model gives more successful results for phone price range prediction and how the performance of the most successful model can be improved.
